Welcome to my personal site! I'm software engineer with more then 10 years of experience. I like new technologies, architecture and sharing my knowledge.
Currently I'm working at TransferWise.<br/>
<br/>
I have a huge experience in developing on Java. I know how to develop reliable systems, applying microservice architecture. Besides those I have very strong analytical skills, and could easily manage myself and the team. All this knowledge I'm sharing on my blog.<br/>
